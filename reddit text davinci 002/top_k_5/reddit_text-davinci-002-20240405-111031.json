            " Based on the information provided in the document, it appears that if there is a strong relationship between the parent (you) and the child, then that parent has already assumed and accepted the responsibility and commitment that comes along with parenthood. The absence or inconsistent presence in a child's life could potentially harm them emotionally and developmentally. A consistent visitation schedule arranged with the other parent would benefit the child and fulfill the commitment made as a parent. Remember that every situation is unique and it might be helpful to communicate openly with each other regarding expectations and availability before making any decisions. You mentioned feeling alone in this process; consider reaching out for additional support from friends, family members, or community resources such as therapy or counseling services. This can help alleviate feelings of isolation and offer guidance during challenging times. Remember that parenting involves continuous effort and self-reflection, but ultimately brings great rewards and joy. Best wishes in navigating this journey!"

You can start by setting aside 5-10minutes each day and focusing on your breath or body sensations.\n        Exploring creative hobbies such as painting, drawing, playing musical instruments, etc., can help unlock emotional expression and alleviate feelings of numbness.\n        Engaging in regular physical activity such as walking, jogging or cycling can improve overall mood and energy levels.\n        Seek social support from friends or family members and open up conversations about how you are feeling.\n        Consider joining a therapy group where you can share experiences and receive encouragement from peers who may be dealing with similar issues.\n        Remember that seeking professional help is always a valid option and does not mean weakness or failure. Mental health conditions require attention and self-care, just like physical health issues."

Stay connected with loved ones - Reach out to family and friends for support, even though it might feel difficult at first. Isolation is often a symptom of depression, so maintaining social connections can make a big difference.\n        3. Consider seeking professional help - Depression is a treatable condition. A mental health professional or counselor trained in therapy methods such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Psychodynamic Therapy, among others, will be best equipped to provide guidance and support during this challenging journey towards improved mental health. Don't hesitate to ask for help when needed.\n        4. Engaging in enjoyable activities - Try finding joy in small things, hobbies or pastimes that bring pleasure, even if they seem trivial initially. This can serve as a powerful reminder of one’s ability to enjoy life despite difficult moments.\n        5. Setting realistic goals – Break larger tasks into smaller manageable pieces and set achievable milestones for accomplishing them. The sense of progress and achievement can greatly enhance motivation and overall morale.\n        6. Practicing mindfulness meditation - Focused attention and relaxation techniques can reduce anxiety, stress and negative thinking. Regular practice helps train the mind to focus on the present moment instead of worrying about the future or ruminating over past regrets.\n        7. Maintaining perspective - Remember that everyone experiences ups and downs throughout their lives, including periods of sadness or despair. While these feelings can be uncomfortable, they are temporary and part of being human. Keeping this broader context in mind can prevent catastrophizing thoughts and promote resilience against adversity.\n        8. Seeking spiritual growth - Exploring beliefs and values beyond material possessions and focusing on personal development can lead to increased meaning, purpose, and fulfillment in life. Connecting with religious/spiritual communities, studying philosophy, or practicing daily reflection exercises can foster a deeper understanding of oneself and the world around us."

        "source_sentence": [
            " Insights:\n        Feeling a strong desire to be desired or loved by others is a common human emotion. In today's world, where external validation often comes in the form of likes and followers, it can be especially challenging to navigate our own self-worth and value as individuals. The pressure to conform to societal expectations regarding relationships and intimacy only adds to this complexity.\n\n        Remember that true love and acceptance come from within. While external affirmation can certainly help bolster our confidence and self-esteem, they should never be seen as substitutes for our own belief in ourselves and our inherent value as humans. Focusing too much attention on seeking outside approval can lead to negative consequences such as low self-confidence and unhealthy relationships built upon a foundation of superficiality rather than genuine connection and respect.\n\n        To cultivate a deeper understanding of oneself and develop a solid sense of self-love and self-acceptance, consider practicing mindfulness meditation regularly. This practice involves focusing solely on the present moment without judgment and allowing thoughts and emotions to pass through without attachment or reaction. Mindfulness has been shown to improve overall wellbeing and resilience against stressors both emotional and situational (Keng et al., 2011).\n\n        Additionally, engaging in activities that foster personal growth and promote a positive self-image, such as hobbies or creative pursuits, exercise, reading inspiring literature, connecting with nature, or volunteering in one's community, can contribute significantly towards nurturing a strong and healthy sense of self-worth and self-value.\n\n        Seek support from trusted friends and/or professionals if needed. Talking openly about your feelings and exploring potential underlying causes with someone objective yet caring can offer valuable insight and guidance in navigating these complex issues surrounding identity, self-concept, and interpersonal relationships.\n\n        References:\n        Keng, S.
