            " Emotional granularity refers to the ability to identify and distinguish between subtle differences in emotions. This skill can improve emotional regulation by helping individuals better understand and respond to their own emotions and those of others. By increasing awareness of specific emotions and recognizing patterns in emotional experience, individuals can develop greater emotional intelligence and respond more adaptively to emotional challenges. Practicing emotional granularity involves paying attention to bodily sensations associated with emotions, identifying emotion labels, reflecting on past emotional experiences, and developing a vocabulary for describing nuanced emotional states. Through this process, individuals can gain insight into their own emotional processes and build resilience against negative emotions while enhancing positive ones."
