            " I believe that statement might be incorrect or incomplete since there isn't a definitive scientific consensus regarding the root causes of anxiety and depression. Instead, research suggests that they typically stem from a mix of biological, psychological, and environmental factors.\n\nAnxiety and depression can indeed be influenced by the health of various bodily organs, hormonal imbalances, and nutritional deficiencies. Nevertheless, addressing those underlying physiological issues does not necessarily yield complete recovery, especially considering the complexity of mental health conditions. Incorporating complementary approaches, such as counseling and therapy, is generally recommended for holistically treating anxiety and depression.\n\nIt's worth noting that although diet and lifestyle modifications can improve overall health and potentially ease symptoms, the healing process for anxiety and depression usually takes longer than the mentioned timeline. Everyone's experience is unique, so progress depends on numerous variables, including the severity and duration of symptoms, genetics, and access to resources, among others. Patiently working toward long-term improvements while receiving appropriate support and care from medical experts remains essential.\n\nIn summary, though focusing on enhancing the functionality of the adrenals, kidneys, and related systems can aid in the recovery process for anxiety and depression, it should not be viewed as a standalone solution. Comprehensive care involving medical consultation, therapy, and lifestyle adjustments provides the best outcomes for those struggling with these mental health conditions."
