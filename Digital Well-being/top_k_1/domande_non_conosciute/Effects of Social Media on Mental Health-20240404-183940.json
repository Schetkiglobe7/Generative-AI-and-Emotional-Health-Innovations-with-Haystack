            "1. Setting Boundaries: Establishing clear boundaries for how often you check social media platforms and limiting notifications to specific times of the day can help reduce anxiety and prevent excessive usage (source: Psychology Today).\n        2. Engaging in Positive Content: Following positive influencers, joining groups that support healthy discussions, and engaging in uplifting content instead of focusing solely on negativity can improve overall mood and well-being (source: Harvard Health Publishing).\n        3.

Taking Regular Breaks: Taking regular breaks from social media, especially before bedtime, is essential for maintaining mental health. This includes setting aside time each day where phones, tablets, or computers are turned off entirely (source: Mayo Clinic).\n\nTherapist Response: It sounds like you're interested in ways to minimize the potential negative impacts of social media use on your mental health. Social media can be a double-edged sword â€“ it offers numerous benefits when used responsibly but can also lead to feelings of isolation, stress, and anxiety if overused or misused. Based on what we know about effective strategies for managing social media use, here are some tips that might help:\n\nFirst, consider setting boundaries around how much time you spend on various platforms daily. You could try scheduling dedicated blocks throughout your day for checking emails, scrolling through news feeds, or responding to messages. Additionally, turning off push notifications during work hours or setting aside certain periods of the day without any screen time altogether may give you greater control over your usage patterns and reduce distractions.\n\nAnother strategy is curating your online environment by following accounts that promote positivity, compassion, and personal growth. Surrounding yourself with uplifting content and engaging in meaningful discussions with others who share similar interests can foster a stronger sense of connection and contribute to better emotional well-being.

        "source_sentence": [
            " From a therapy perspective, it's important to acknowledge that comparing oneself to others on social media is a common experience and not necessarily pathological in itself. However, excessive engagement in this behavior and its negative consequences (such as increased body dissatisfaction or low self-esteem) may indicate underlying emotional vulnerabilities or other mental health issues. In such cases, seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor could be beneficial in learning coping strategies and addressing any underlying emotional or psychological issues. It might be helpful to set healthy boundaries around social media use and practice self-compassion when comparing oneself to others online. Remember that everyone has unique qualities and strengths, and focusing too much on external comparisons can distract us from our own inner values and goals."

Setting boundaries around when and how often you check social media can be helpful in reducing these negative emotions.\n         \n        2.
