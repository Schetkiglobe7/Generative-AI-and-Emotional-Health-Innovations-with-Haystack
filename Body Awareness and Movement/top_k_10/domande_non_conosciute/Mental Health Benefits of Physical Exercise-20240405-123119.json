            " To sum up, incorporating regular physical activity into your routine can positively impact emotional regulation by helping reduce stress and anxiety, improving sleep quality, boosting mood and self-esteem, and providing a healthy distraction from negative thoughts and feelings. However, it's essential to remember that exercise alone may not completely address complex mental health issues; seeking additional support such as therapy and/or medication under the supervision of healthcare professionals should be considered when necessary. Incorporating relaxation techniques like meditation, deep breathing, and yoga into daily life can further enhance emotional resilience."
