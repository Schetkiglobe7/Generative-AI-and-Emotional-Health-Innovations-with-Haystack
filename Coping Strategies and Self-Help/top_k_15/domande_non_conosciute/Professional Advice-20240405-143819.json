            " Whether a person comes to therapy with many issues on their heart and mind or whether he / she comes with something specific, one issue leads to another.Whether a person comes to therapy with many issues on their heart and mind or whether he / she comes with something specific, one issue leads to another.One possibility is that your loved one is experiencing symptoms of their illness that are impacting their ability to communicate and interact in a positive way. It's important to try to be understanding and patient, but it is also okay to set boundaries as needed. If their behavior is becoming too much for you to handle, you may need to seek out additional support from other family members, friends, or professional caregivers. \n        \n        Based on these documents, here are some suggestions for maintaining boundaries while providing empathetic care:\n        1. Communicate clearly and respectfully - When expressing your emotions or setting limits, ensure that you convey your message in a calm, non-confrontational tone. Respect the other person’s perspective even if you disagree.\n        2. Practice active listening - Empathetic communication requires that you fully engage in the conversation. Listen carefully to the speaker and reflect back what you hear to demonstrate that you understand their point of view.\n        3. Set realistic expectations - Be clear about what you are comfortable doing and what you aren’t. Setting unrealistic goals or making promises you can't keep can lead to frustration and resentment.\n        4. Take breaks - Caring for others emotionally can be draining, so make sure to take time for self-care. Schedule regular activities that recharge your batteries and create space between interactions.\n        5. Seek outside support - Don't hesitate to enlist the help of colleagues, supervisors, or mental health professionals if caring for someone becomes overwhelming. Remember that seeking assistance is a strength, not a weakness.\n        6. Focus on solutions - Instead of dwelling on problems, focus on potential solutions. Encourage problem solving skills in the person you are caring for and collaborate on finding mutually beneficial outcomes."
